						  Take a look at the following 8 my future goals examples so you can get started today. 
						  And before you know it, you’ll be well on your way to a better, more fulfilling life.<br><hr>
                                        <strong>1. Read a New Book Every Month</strong><br>
                                            The first on this list of future goals examples is reading a new book every month. 
                                             This is an ambitious goal that’ll make you grow personally and professionally. How? 
                                             By allowing you to learn more each day than most people do in their entire lives.

                                             Any time spent reading can be done either at home with family (or alone), 
                                            during a lunch break from work, or even before bedtime. The important thing, though, 
                                           is using what you read about to change your habits. And over time, it’s practically 
                                           guaranteed to change your life for the better.<br><hr>

                                  <strong>2. Build a Website and Blog</strong><br>
                                   This is great because it teaches you how to find your voice, figure out what you want to say, 
                                      and share your message. You might also learn about new technologies or tools that can help work more efficiently. 
                                   It’s an opportunity to turn words into action! And this is great whether for your personal development or career purposes as well.

                                       Even better, you can use it to demonstrate your career expertise, 
                                    which could potentially attract more business opportunities your way.<br><hr>

                            <strong>3. Develop a More Active Lifestyle</strong><br>
                              Incorporating an active lifestyle into your routine will make you feel better, be more energetic, 
                            and improve your health. You’ll even have a higher chance of living longer as well. And the best part?
                            It doesn’t need to be a difficult task. You can easily find ways to make this happen, 
                             whether it’s by taking your dog for walks in the evening or working out with friends on weekends.<br><hr>

                                <strong>4. Find New Passions to Explore</strong><br>
                            This goal is helpful because it gives you time to rediscover yourself. You might find this goal 
                            sparks a whole new interest in something. If that’s the case, you can explore it for a few months 
                            and then find another passion to pursue—or even combine two passions into one! This gives 
                            your goals meaning and essentially, this means your life has more meaning as well.<br><hr>

                               <strong>5. Learn New Skills in Your Field</strong><br>
                               You’ll find this helpful because it allows you to keep up with trends, 
                              stay relevant in your industry, and have something new for yourself or others. 
                              You might also get to use your new skills in a job interview or work project, 
                             which could lead to more work opportunities and better job prospects as well.<br><hr>

                       <strong>6. Take on New Projects at Work</strong><br>
                    Experimenting with new projects will help you grow in your career and learn more 
                     about the goals for a company or how other teams work. It might also teach you 
                      something unexpected that can be applied to another project as well.<br><hr>

                     <strong>7. Make Time for Friends and Family</strong><br>
                       This is a great way to help you feel more fulfilled with your social life. 
                      This might be meeting up for coffee or dinner, going out on a date night, 
                     or simply taking care of your pet together. You’ll get to catch up and 
                    share quality moments that can’t always happen when you’re busy. And often, 
                   it’s these slow, quiet moments that stay with us the longest.<br><hr>

                   <strong>8. Do Charity Work</strong><br>
                         By taking on this kind of future goal, you’re giving back to the world and making 
                        a difference. Even better, you might be able to meet new people and make connections 
                       with others that share similar interests, as you’re more likely to volunteer somewhere you feel strongly about.<br>
                       To <b>sum</b> up you must have a future plan because that is the thing motivatis you that is the thing makes you disciplen
